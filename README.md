# IT blog
My blog about data science, machine learning, c++, python, and other IT-oriented things that's interested to me.

Ideas for projects:

1. Text summarizing using BERT, Transformers, etc.
Dataset for this task: https://github.com/mahnazkoupaee/WikiHow-Dataset (csv file can be downloaded by link inside (590 MB) )
2. Telegram-bot with NLP (maybe with 1 point, or some another useful info)
3. Text analyzing for fake news, or lack of information and evidence.
