# IT blog
My blog about data science, machine learning, c++, python, and other IT-oriented things that's interested to me.

## ML/DS News: https://infomate.club/ml/

## Ideas for projects:

1. Text summarizing using BERT, Transformers, etc.
Dataset for this task: https://github.com/mahnazkoupaee/WikiHow-Dataset (csv file can be downloaded by link inside (590 MB) )
2. Telegram-bot with NLP (maybe with 1 point, or some another useful info)
3. Text analyzing for fake news, or lack of information and evidence.

## C++ notes:

Interview questions quotes:

I like to just have a chat to start: what do they like about C++, dislike, how it compares to other languages, do they follow newer standards, what do they think of UB. If I'm asking C++ specific coding, I've asked them to implement something like std::function.
